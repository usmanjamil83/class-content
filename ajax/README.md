## Unit 6 - Introduction to APIs and AJAX

### Overview

In this week we will be introducing students to the concept of APIs and the use of AJAX queries to retrieve and parse data in JSON formats. Throughout the week we'll be specifically working with the Giphy, OMDb, and New York Times APIs.

Be sure to slack out this [tutorial on the OpenWeatherMap API](http://osp123.github.io/tutorials/html/weatherAPI.html) as pre-reading for this week's content.
