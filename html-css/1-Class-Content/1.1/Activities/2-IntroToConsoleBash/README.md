#Intro to Console/Bash


##From the Terminal/Console, using only the command line, create the following:
1. A new folder with the name of first-day-stuff
2. A new HTML file with the name of first-day.html
3. Open the current folder containing the new HTML file.

##Bonus

  * Create multiple directories/folders with the names one_folder and second_folder using a single command.
