# 23 - 3 Languages in 3 Days

### Overview


The purpose of this unit is to provide students with cursory exposure to major languages other than JavaScript: Java, Python, and Ruby.

### Homework Activities

There is no graded homework this week. If students are so inclined, however, they are encouraged to implement the activities featured in this week's lesson plans in the language of their choosing. We enthusiastically recommend [Clojurescript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) or [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/).

### Key Activities

Each lesson implements the same console application in a different language. The terminal activity introduces each language's object-oriented capacities, and culminates in the cleanest implementation students produce.
