# Unit 11 Assignment: Cloze Constructors

### Overview

In this week's assignment, you will create the backend for a basic flashcard application.

The backend will essentially constitute an API that allows users to create two types of flashcards.

1. **Basic** flashcards, which have a front (_"Who was the first president of the United States?"_), and a back (_"George Washington"_).

2. **Cloze-Deleted** flashcards, which present _partial_ text (_"... was the first president of the United States."_), and the full text when the user requests it (_"George Washington was the first president of the United States."_)

#### Cloze Deletions

A **cloze deletion** is simply a sentence that has had some of its text removed. For example, given the sentence:

_"George Washington was the first president of the United States."_

...We can create a "cloze deletion" by removing the words _"George Washington"_:

_"... was the first president of the United States."_

This is useful for building flash card applications that forces users to remember the important part of a sentence, and is [a common device in educational applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test).

A flash card built this way has three parts:

1. The **full text**. This is the entire sentence users need to remember:  _"George Washington was the first president of the United States."_

2. The **cloze deletion**. This is the text we've chosen to remove: _"George Washington"_.

3. The **partial text**. This is what we get if we remove the **cloze deletion** from the **full text**: _"... was the first president of the United States._

See below for examples as to how your constructor should behave.

### Remember

You will be fully capable of doing this homework by the end of Saturday's class.

## Instructions

* Create a new GitHub repository, named `Flashcard-Generator` or something similar. Clone this to your local drive.

* Create a `BasicCard` constructor. It should accept `front` and `back` arguments.

* Create a `ClozeCard` constructor. It should accept `text` and `cloze` arguments.

  * `ClozeCard` should have a property or method that contains or returns _only_ the cloze-deleted portion of the text.

  * `ClozeCard` should have a property or method that contains or returns _only_ the partial text.

  * `ClozeCard` should have a property or method that contains or returns _only_ the full text.

  * `ClozeCard` should throw or log an error when the cloze deletion does _not_ appear in the input text.

  * Use prototypes to attach these methods, wherever possible.

As your application will not have a front end, your only need to determine an efficient way to store cloze-deleted cards—you don't have to solve the problem of displaying them. You are free to decide how you'd like to implement this. One might represent the above flashcard thus:

The bulk of this assignment is implementing `ClozeCard`. If you build a robust `ClozeCard` implementation, feel free to try your hand at implementing a front-end, as well.

### Examples

Your constructors should work as follows.

```
var firstPresident = new BasicCard(
    "Who was the first president of the United States?", "George Washington");

// "Who was the first president of the United States?"
console.log(firstPresident.front);

// "George Washington"
console.log(firstPresident.back);

var firstPresidentCloze = new ClozeCard(
    "George Washington was the first president of the United States.", "George Washington");

// "George Washington"
console.log(firstPresidentCloze.cloze);

// " ... was the first president of the United States.
console.log(firstPresidentCloze.partial); "

// "George Washington was the first president of the United States.
console.log(firstPresidentCloze.fullText): "

// Should throw or log an error because "oops" doesn't appear in "This doesn't work"
var brokenCloze = clozeDeletion("This doesn't work", "oops"); 
```

Your property and/or method names can be different, but these examples describe how you would use your flashcard objects.

### Bonuses

* Write your constructors such that users can call them with or without the `new` keyword.

  * Look up scope-safe constructors, and try to implement them. It takes only two additional lines of code.

### One More Thing

If you have any questions about this project or the material we have covered, please post them in the community channels in slack so that your fellow developers can help you! If you're still having trouble, you can come to office hours for assistance from your instructor and TAs.

**Good Luck!**
